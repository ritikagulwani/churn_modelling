 ## Results & Insights
Classification reports (precision, recall, F1‑score) for each model.

Confusion matrices and ROC-AUC curves included.

Variable importance from Random Forest.

ANN performance exceeds traditional models at F1 ~0.86.

 ## Usage & Deployment
Easily refactorable via Churn_Modelling.py for batch predictions.

Extendable to include hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and model stacking.

Ideal for integrating into customer retention decision-making pipelines.
